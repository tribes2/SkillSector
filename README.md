# Modes
## Flying aim training
### Beginner difficulty
Static targets. Shots will only count when the player is...
 - In the air
 - Travelling at a minimum velocity

Different weapons will have different scores based on their 'ease' of hitting a static target.\
Static targets will be both on the ground and in the air.\
Hitting a static target with splash damage will count, but won't grant much score compared to a direct hit.

### Moderate difficulty
Moving targets. Splash damage does not count. Same rules as previous.

### Advanced difficulty
Fast moving targets. Same rules as previous.

## Human duel arena(s)
Humans should be able to schedule a duel between themselves. I like the way that TG did it.

## Robot duel arena(s)
Humans should be able to select from various difficulty robots for dueling.

## Flag toss/catch practice
Flag tossing and flag catching require a fair bit of practice. Doing so manually or between players 

#### auxiliary todo list / odds and ends
 - noIndividualDamage could be set for the roof's power stations, making it possible to annoy other players by disabling FloatingBank's inventory station(s)
